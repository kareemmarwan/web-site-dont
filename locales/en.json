   "shortStory": "My name is Kareem, and Iâ€™m a Palestinian from Gaza City . Before the war, I worked as a software engineer in the tech market. Iâ€™ve lived here since birth with my large family, which includes my retired father (64 years old), my motherâ€”a homemaker who underwent surgery to remove a tumor in 2021â€”four brothers, and five sisters. We all lived together under one roof and We have 13 children â€“ my sisters' kids â€“ and they are all still young. They live with us in the same place. Life before the war was sometimes difficult, but it was stable. I worked daily, had a laptop, internet access, and the resources to earn a living. But since the war began, everything has changed. We live near the separation fence, and weâ€™ve been forced to flee multiple times in search of safety. Our area was hit with intense bombingâ€”I witnessed three barrel bombs fall, destroying 13 homes and killing several of our neighbors.",
    "fullStory": "My name is Kareem, and Iâ€™m from Gaza City. Before the war, I worked as a software engineer in the tech market. Iâ€™ve lived here since birth with my large family, which includes my retired father (64 years old), my motherâ€”a homemaker who underwent surgery to remove a tumor in 2021â€”four brothers, and five sisters. We all lived together under one roof.\n\nLife before the war was sometimes difficult, but it was stable. I worked daily, had a laptop, internet access, and the resources to earn a living. But since the war began, everything has changed. We live near the separation fence, and weâ€™ve been forced to flee multiple times in search of safety. Our area was hit with intense bombingâ€”I witnessed three barrel bombs fall, destroying 13 homes and killing several of our neighbors.\n\nMy family and I sustained injuries ranging from mild to moderate. I lost all my work toolsâ€”I no longer have a laptop or any source of income. My siblings have had their education disrupted; they canâ€™t attend school or university. Living here has become a constant riskâ€”every second feels like we might lose our lives. Weâ€™ve also endured periods of starvation and severe shortages of basic necessities. We've received some aid from UNRWA, but itâ€™s not enough to secure a future for an entire family.\n\nRight now, we dream of something simple but vital: To leave Gaza for a safer place, where we can restore our dignity, secure our childrenâ€™s education and future, continue my motherâ€™s treatment, and obtain temporary housing, food, basic essentials, and a laptop so my siblings can resume their studies and I can return to work.\n\nOur goal isnâ€™t permanent migration â€” itâ€™s survival and rebuilding a dignified life, far from bombings and daily danger.\n\nHow donations will be used (full transparency):\n\n- Travel/visa fees and emergency transportation for the family\n- Rent for safe and suitable housing for 3â€“6 months as temporary shelter\n- Medical treatment and follow-up care for my mother, as well as other family healthcare needs\n- Basic necessities: food, clothing, childrenâ€™s supplies, and school materials\n- A basic laptop and internet access so I can resume my work as a software developer to support the family\n\nAny amount you donate will be a lifeline of hope for us. We will provide regular updates on how the funds are being used, including photos/documents whenever possible, to ensure transparency for every donor and supporter.\n\nWeâ€™re not asking for muchâ€”just a chance to survive and rebuild a simple life for a family that loves its land but seeks safety.\n\nYour donation means a child goes back to school, a mother receives her treatment, and our parents can live each moment without fear.\n\nThank you from the bottom of our hearts to everyone who reads, shares, and supports. Goodness still existsâ€”because of people like you. We pray that God protects you and all the people of the world from war and destruction."
